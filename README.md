# DFIR-Malware-Windows

When you are threathunting for malware across 100s of systems; it gets quiet confusing.

This script would grab all the users in a directory C:\Users

# 1 Grab $users

This directory is where mostly malware gets in first; but you may also try C:\ or C:\Windows as well for interesting path's. I STRONGLY  recommend to scan only UNSIGNED files "except LetsEncrypt".

# 2 Scan $files 

It uses sigcheck to scan for all files which don't match extensions *.dat, *.jpg, *.gif etc and if the file is less than 1mb within the C:\$Users\ Directory.

You can change this to 2mb even for better results as most malware is actually below 2mb.

Finally gives you the output in a .csv file with virustotal results.
